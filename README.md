### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

# 🚘 AI-Powered Prompting Experiment: Self-Driving Cars at Crowded Intersections

## 📌 Scenario
How can self-driving cars prioritize safety when navigating crowded intersections?

Self-driving cars face complex decision-making challenges in crowded intersections where pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles move unpredictably.  
The aim of this experiment is to apply *different AI prompting techniques* to analyze strategies, compare alternatives, and evaluate the effectiveness of *safety-first navigation*.

---

## 🔹 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
### 📝 Prompt Example
> Compare how self-driving cars can prioritize safety at crowded intersections using three different approaches:  
> 1. Sensor fusion with LiDAR + cameras  
> 2. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication  
> 3. AI-based risk prediction models.  
> Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and best use cases.

### 🤖 AI Response (Expected)
- *Sensor fusion (LiDAR + cameras):* High accuracy in object detection but limited in bad weather.  
- *V2X communication:* Enhances coordination, but depends on infrastructure and other vehicles being compatible.  
- *AI-based risk prediction:* Learns patterns of pedestrian/vehicle behavior but requires huge datasets.

*✅ Comparative Insight:*  
- Sensor fusion ensures *real-time awareness*  
- V2X improves *coordination*  
- AI prediction adds *foresight*  
➡ *Best solution: Combine all three.*

## 🔹 2. Comparative Analysis Prompt (Alternative Framing)
### 📝 Prompt Example
> Evaluate how safety prioritization differs when self-driving cars adopt a *conservative decision-making model* versus an *assertive decision-making model* at intersections. Which approach minimizes accidents and which ensures smoother traffic flow?

### 🤖 AI Response (Expected)
- *Conservative model:* Stops frequently, minimizes collisions, ensures pedestrian safety.  
- *Assertive model:* Reduces traffic congestion, may take calculated risks.  

*✅ Comparative Insight:*  
- Conservative = *safer but less efficient*  
- Assertive = *smoother flow but riskier*  
➡ Best = *Hybrid adaptive model (context-aware switching).*

## 🔹 3. Prompt Size Limitations Technique
### Short Prompt
*Prompt:* "How should self-driving cars ensure safety at busy intersections?"  
*AI Response:* Use sensors, predict movements, obey traffic laws, prioritize pedestrians.

### Extended Prompt
*Prompt:* "Explain how self-driving cars can ensure safety at crowded intersections by addressing pedestrian unpredictability, multi-vehicle interactions, weather interference, and ethical trade-offs in accident-prevention decisions."  
*AI Response:* Multi-layered strategies → advanced perception, V2X integration, ethical decision frameworks, redundancies.

*✅ Observation:*  
- *Short prompts* = General, surface-level responses  
- *Extended prompts* = Rich, structured insights
